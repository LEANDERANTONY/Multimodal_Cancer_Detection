## Context
The original Research Proposal (RP) outlined a **multimodal deep learning pipeline** for early pancreatic cancer detection using **paired** CT imaging and **both urinary and blood biomarkers** from the same patients. The plan included:

- Preprocessing paired CT scans + biomarker tables  
- Feature extraction from CT via CNN  
- Feature extraction from biomarkers via MLP  
- Feature-level fusion for classification  
- Benchmarking against unimodal baselines  

During implementation planning, several **practical constraints** emerged:

1. **Data availability**  
   - Public CT datasets and biomarker datasets exist but **are not paired** (different patient cohorts).  
   - Paired public datasets containing CT + urine + blood biomarkers for the same patient are not currently available.

2. **Hardware constraints**  
   - Local machine has **16GB RAM, integrated graphics** — not suitable for full deep learning training on CT volumes.
   - GPU access limited to **Google Colab Pro** for heavy training.

3. **Time constraints**  
   - Thesis final presentation due **September 15, 2025** (~5 weeks from decision date).
   - Need to ensure reproducible results and avoid high-risk pipeline dependencies.

## Decision
The following **scope and architecture changes** are made:

### 1. Drop blood biomarker modeling from current thesis scope
- **RP Plan:** Use both urinary and blood biomarker datasets.
- **Change:** Focus only on **urinary biomarkers** for biochemical modality.
- **Rationale:**  
  - No public dataset pairs blood and urine for the same patients.  
  - Avoids unvalidated synthetic pairing between two unrelated biochemical cohorts.
  - Reduces preprocessing/training complexity within deadline.

---

### 2. Unimodal-first approach with simulation-based fusion experiments
- **RP Plan:** Train a full multimodal fusion model on paired CT + biomarker data.
- **Change:**  
  - Deliver unimodal pipelines for **CT** and **urine** separately (real data).  
  - Run **fusion strategy comparison** (late fusion, early concat, orthogonal fusion) only on **synthetic paired data** created via stratified pairing.
- **Rationale:**  
  - Maintains multimodal methodology exploration without claiming clinical pairing.  
  - Provides a fusion “bake-off” that can guide future paired-cohort studies.  
  - Keeps thesis defensible under peer review — no misleading data assumptions.

---

### 3. Introduce YOLO ROI extraction in CT pipeline
- **RP Plan:** Direct CNN classification on full CT slices.
- **Change:** Preprocess CT scans with **YOLOv8** to detect pancreas/tumor ROI, crop, then pass to CNN (e.g., ResNet50/EfficientNet).
- **Rationale:**  
  - Inspired by Dinesh et al. (2023) showing improved performance by localizing tumor region before classification.
  - Likely to boost sensitivity by reducing background noise.

---

### 4. Adapt architecture inspiration from multimodal literature
- **RP Plan:** Use generic fusion block for multimodal learning.
- **Change:** Evaluate three adapted fusion strategies from multimodal literature on synthetic pairs:  
  1. **Late fusion** (decision-level, weighted average/logistic stacking)  
  2. **Early concat fusion** (feature-level MLP)  
  3. **Orthogonal fusion** (complementarity-aware feature fusion)  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Aligns with strategies in Pathomic Fusion, Deep Orthogonal Fusion, and HEALNet.  
  - Gives empirical insight into which strategy to prioritize for future paired studies.

---

### 5. Compute strategy
- **RP Plan:** Train all models locally.
- **Change:**  
  - **CT models** → Train on Google Colab Pro (GPU) with Drive-mounted data.  
  - **Urine MLP + fusion experiments** → Run locally (CPU OK).  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Colab Pro offers GPU acceleration needed for YOLO + CNN.  
  - Keeps local work for lightweight models and data prep.

---

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Ensures feasible completion within time & hardware limits.
- Maintains methodological novelty (ROI-based CT + fusion strategy comparison).
- Future-proof: fusion experiments can be repeated with real paired datasets later.

**Negative:**
- Cannot report real-world multimodal performance on paired data.
- Blood biomarker analysis excluded from current thesis scope.
- Fusion results will be simulation-based, clearly labeled as such.

---

## Future Work
When a paired CT + urine + blood biomarker dataset becomes available:
1. Replace synthetic pairing with real patient-level pairing.
2. Re-train fusion models with best strategy from simulation bake-off.
3. Expand biochemical branch to include both urine and blood panels.
